# Purgatory
Final Project for CMSI 185
Situation: You were once an occult leader that reformed after the promises of necromancy to revive your wife failed to bring her back. You spent the rest of your days coming to terms with her death and devoting yourself to the salvation of others. As you died, the community mourned for the loss of a good man.

Yet they never knew your past.

You wake up in what looks like your home, but its different. It looks lke it did the night you tried to bring yourwife back: the circle you used to try and revive your wife, the limb you ate for the ritual, and the pile of children you took to bring her back. Now in Purgatory, you must atone for your sins until you can rest easy, but those children won't make that easy. 

Goal: Survive for as long as you can, the crosses that appear will help put them to rest and your trusty dummy (CTRL) seems good enough to distract them for a while. You can SHIFT to teleport (an occult leader should always have a trick ready), but something's...off... in Purgatory. When you try to teleport anywhere, the place always sends you back to that damned circle, reminding you that "You can't outrun your sins."  You've taken many lives during your younger days... how long will it take to save them? Can you even live long enough to do it? Welcome to Purgatory.
